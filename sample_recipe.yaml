# FBTK Sample Recipe Template
# This file can be used as a base for building your own systems.

system:
  # Target density in g/cm^3
  density: 0.5
  # Optional: Explicit cell dimensions [Lx, Ly, Lz] in Angstroms
  # If cell_shape is null, it will be calculated from density and mass.
  cell_shape: [30.0, 30.0, 30.0]

components:
  # Example 1: A Polymer Component
  - name: "Polystyrene"
    role: "polymer"
    input:
      # Use '*' markers for RadonPy-style SMILES
      smiles: "*C(C*)c1ccccc1"
    polymer_params:
      # Degree of polymerization (number of monomers)
      degree: 10
      # Number of polymer chains to place
      n_chains: 2
      # Tacticity: isotactic, syndiotactic, or atactic
      tacticity: "atactic"

  # Example 2: A Small Molecule Component (Solvent/Additive)
  - name: "Ethanol"
    role: "molecule"
    input:
      smiles: "CCO"
    # Number of molecules to place
    count: 20
